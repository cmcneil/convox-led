Welcome!

Overview
--------

We wanted to create a simple interface for controlling Adafruit LED strands.
This server is run on a Raspberry Pi connected to the LED strand, and recieves
messages under the protocol discribed below.

Protocol
--------
Currently, the project is such that a server (the Raspberry Pi) accepts all UDP packets using the protocol we lay out in the proto file.
I know the docs are incomplete (mostly in-code and in the proto-file). Working on that. If you have questions, feel free to ping me!

That's it! Have fun.
