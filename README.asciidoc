Welcome!

Overview
--------

We wanted to create a simple interface for controlling Adafruit LED strands.
This server is run on a Raspberry Pi connected to the LED strand, and recieves
messages under the protocol discribed below.

Protocol
--------
Currently, the project is such that a server (the Raspberry Pi) accepts all TCP packets using the protocol we lay out here.
The input consists of a header byte, two optional index bytes, and three color
bytes, which are required for all headers except the update command. The bits in
the header are as follows:

|==================
| bit | Use/meaning
| 0 | Update
| 1 | Push
| 2 | Set
| 3 | Fill
| 4 | Reverse
| 5 | Rotate
| 6 | Hypotnuse
| 7 | HSV
--------------------
| 16 bits | _Optional:_ Index unisgned short. For operations where a particular light must be specified.
| 8 bits | _Optional:_ *R/H* 0-255, either Red, or Hue depending on whether or not bit 7 is set
| 8 bits | _Optional:_ *G/S* 0-255, either Green, or Saturation, depending on whether or not bit 7 is set
| 8 bits | _Optional:_ *B/V* 0-255, either Blue, or Value, depending on whether or not bit 7 is set
|==================

That's it! Have fun.
